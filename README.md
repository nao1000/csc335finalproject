# Scrabble - 335 Final Project
CSC 335: Final Project

This GitHub repository is a version of the game Scrabble. It follows the rules of the standard board game, and it includes the board of the original game as well. The program includes a dictionary of words that are considered valid, and a letter list associated with their equivalent point values. To use the game, you will interact with the GUI and drag letters to correct spots. If you would like to clear the board or change the tiles, there are buttons that accomplish both of those tasks. Our version of the game allows for two people to play the game at once. Overall, it was a good project that incorporated a variety of the topics discussed in CSC335.
