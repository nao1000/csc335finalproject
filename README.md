# Scrabble - 335 Final Project
CSC 335: Final Project

This GitHub repository is a version of the game Scrabble. It follows the rules of the standard board game, and it includes
the board of the original game as well. The program includes a dictionary of words that are considered valid and a letter
list associated with their equivalent point values. To use the game, you will interact with the GUI and drag letters to
the correct spots. If you would like to clear the board or change the tiles, there are buttons that accomplish both of those
tasks. Our version of the game allows for two people to play the game at once. Overall, it was a good project that
incorporated a variety of the topics discussed in CSC335. 

**Overall Rules**
1. Each player is randomly given 7 letter tiles
2. The first word must be placed incorporating the center tile (has to be 2+ letters)
3. The submit button will validate your move. If an invalid word is played it will let you retry (this is similar to online Scrabble)
4. The discard button is unforgiving--it locks all other buttons. If you discard, click the letters you want to discard and click the button again.
5. Hitting discard twice without selecting any tiles is effectively skipping your turn. However, when the tiles left is below 7, the discard button locks.
6. Skip will simply swap the current player
7. Quit allows you to reset the game or exit the application
8. Clear allows you to return all of the unsubmitted but placed tiles back to your hand.

UML diagram is included to show how everything connects.
